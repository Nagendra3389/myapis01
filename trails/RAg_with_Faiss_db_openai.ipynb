Integrated circuits are the building blocks of \\nmost electronic devices and equipment. An integrated circuit is also known as a chip or \\nmicrochip. \\nThere are two main advantages of ICs over discrete circuits: cost and performance. Cost is \\nlow because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather  \\nthan being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermor e, much less material is used to construct a \\npackaged IC die than a discrete circuit. Performance is high since the components switch quickly and \\nconsume little power (compared to their discrete counterparts) because the components are small and \\npositioned close together. As of 2006, chip areas range from a few square millimeters to around 350 \\nmm2, with up to 1 million transistors per mm '),\n",

This is shown in the Figure 1.9 (b). \\n(c) Then, the field oxide is selectively etched to expose the silicon surface on which the MOS \\ntransistor will be created. This is indicated in the Figure 1.9 (c). \\n(d) This is followed by covering the surface of substrate with a thin, high-quality oxide layer, which \\nwill eventually form the gate oxide of the \\nMOS transistor as illustrated in Figure 1.9 (d). \\n(e) On top of the thin oxide, a layer of polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon) is deposited as is shown in \\nthe Figure 1.9 (e). Polysilicon is used both as gate electrode material for MOS transistors and also as \\nan interconnect medium in silicon integrated circuits. Undoped p olysilicon has relatively high \\nresistivity. The resistivity of polysilicon can be reduced, however, by doping it with impurity atoms. \\n(f) After deposition, the polysilicon layer is patterned and etched to form the interconnects and the \\nMOS transistor gates. This is shown in Figure 1.9 (f). \\n(g) The thin gate oxide not covered by polysilicon is also etched along, which exposes the bare \\nsilicon surface on which the source and drain junctions are to be formed (Figure 1.9 (g)). \\n(h) The entire silicon surface is then doped with high concentration of impurities, either through \\ndiffusion or ion implantation (in this case with donor atoms to produce n -type doping). Diffusion is \\nachieved by heating the wafer to a high temperature and passing the gas containing desired impurities \\nover the surface. Figure 1.9 (h) shows that the doping penetrates the exposed areas on the silicon \\nsurface, ultimately creating two n -type regions (source and drain junctions) in the p -type substrate. \\nThe impurity doping also penetrates the polysilicon on the surface, reducing its resistivity. \\n(i) Once the source and drain regions are completed, the entire surface is again covered with an \\ninsulating layer of silicon dioxide, as shown in \\nFigure 1.9 (i).(j) The insulating oxide layer is then patterned in order to provide contact windows for \\nthe drain and source junctions, as illustrated in Figure 1.9 (j).

Therefore, a set of layout rules, al so called design \\nrules, has been defined. They act as an interface or communication link between the circuit \\ndesigner and the process engineer during the manufacturing phase. The objective associated with \\nlayout rules is to obtain a circuit with optimum yi eld (functional circuits versus non -functional \\ncircuits) in as small as area possible without compromising reliability of the circuit. In addition, \\nDesign rules can be conservative or aggressive, depending on whether yield or performance is \\ndesired. Generally, they are a compromise between the two. Manufacturing processes have their \\ninherent limitations in accuracy. So the need of design rules arises due to manufacturing \\nproblems like – \\n• Photo resist shrinkage, tearing. \\n• Variations in material deposition, temperature and oxide thickness. \\n• Impurities. \\n• Variations across a wafer. \\nThese lead to various problems like : \\n• Transistor problems: \\nVariations in threshold voltage: This may occur due to variations in oxide thickness, ion - \\nimplantation and poly layer. Changes in source/drain diffusion overlap. Variations in \\nsubstrate. \\n• Wiring problems: \\nDiffusion: There is variation in doping which results in variations in resistance, \\ncapacitance. Poly, metal: Variations in height, width resulting in variations in resistance, \\ncapacitance. Shorts and opens. \\n• Oxide problems: \\nVariations in height. \\nLack of planarity. \\n \\n• Via problems: \\nVia may not be cut all the way through. '),\n",

This consists of minimum -width and minimum-spacing constraints and \\nrequirements between objects on the same or different layers. Apart from following a definite set \\nof rules, design rules also come by experience. \\nWhy we use design rules? \\n• Interface between designer and process engineer \\n• Historically, the process technology referred to the length of the silicon channel \\nbetween the source and drain terminals in field effect transistors. \\n• The sizes of other features are generally derived as a ratio of the channel length, \\nwhere some may be larger than the channel size and some smaller. \\nFor example, in a 90 nm process, the length of the channel may be 90 nm, but the width of the \\ngate terminal may be only 50 nm. \\n'),\n",

Among the three \\nthe latter two, the buried contact is the most widely used, because of advantage in space and a \\nreliable contact. At one time butting contacts were widely used , but now a days they  are \\nsuperseded by buried contacts. \\nIn CMOS designs, poly. to diff. contacts are always made via metal. A simple process is \\nfollowed for making connections between metal and either of the other two layers (as in Fig.a), \\nThe 2λ. x 2λ. contact cut indicates an area in which the oxide is to be removed down to the \\nunderlying polysilicon or diffusion surface. When deposition of the metal layer takes place the \\nmetal is deposited through the contact cut areas onto the underlying area so that contact is made \\nbetween the layers. \\nThe process is more complex for connecting diffusion to poly-silicon using the butting \\ncontact approach (Fig.b), In effect, a 2λ. x 2λ contact cut is made down to each of the layers to  \\nbe joined. The layers are butted together in such a way that these two contact cuts become \\ncontiguous. Since the poly-silicon and diffusion outlines overlap and thin oxide under poly \\nsilicon acts as a mask in the diffusion process, the poly-silicon and diffusion layers are also \\nbutted together. The contact between the two butting layers is then made by a metal overlay as \\nshown in the Fig. '),\n",

This helps to avoid the \\nformation of unwanted transistors. So this buried contact approach is simpler when compared to \\nothers. The, poly -silicon is deposited directly on the underlying crystalline wafer. When \\ndiffusion takes place, impurities will diffuse into the poly -silicon as well as into the diffusion \\nregion within the contact area.

When the nMOS logic block discharges the out node during evaluation \\n(Fig. 5.12), the inverter output out goes high, turning off the feedback pMOS. When out is evaluated \\nhigh (high impedance in the dynamic gate), then the inverter output goes low, turning on the \\nfeedback pMOS device and providing a low impedance path to VDD, This prevents the out node from \\nfloating, making it less sensitive to node voltage drift, noise and current leakage. \\nDomino CMOS allows logic gate cascading since all inputs are set to zero during precharge, \\navoiding erroneous evaluation from different delays. This logic allows static operation from the \\nfeedback latching pMOS, but logic evaluation still needs two sub cycles: precharge and evaluation. \\n'),\n",

Each \\ndesign style has its own merits and shortcomings, and thus a proper choice has to be made by designers in order to \\nprovide the specified functionality at low cost and in a timely manner. \\n \\n Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)  Fully fabricated FPGA chips containing thousands or even more, of \\nlogic gates with programmable interconnects, are available to users for their custom hardware programming to \\nrealize desired functionality. This design style provides a means for fast prototyping and also for cost-effective chip \\ndesign, especially for low-volume applications. A typical field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip consists of I/O \\nbuffers, an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs), and programmable interconnect structures. The programming \\nof the interconnects is accomplished by programming of RAM cells whose output terminals are connected to the \\ngates of MOS pass transistors. Thus, the signal routing between the CLBs and the I/O blo cks is accomplished by \\nsetting the configurable switch matrices accordingly. The general architecture of an FPGA chip fr om Xilinx .  \\nshowing the locations of switch matrices used for interconnect routing.  \\n \\n \\n \\nGate Array Design :In terms of fast prototyping capability, the gate array (GA) ranks second after the FPGA with a \\ntypical turn -around time of a few days. While user programming is central to the design implementation of the \\nFPGA chip, metal mask design and processing is used for GA. Gate ar ray implementation requires a two -step \\nmanufacturing process: The first phase, which is based on generic (standard) masks, results in an array of \\nuncommitted transistors on each GA chip. These uncommitted chips can be stored for later customization, which is \\ncompleted by defining the metal interconnects between the trans istors of the array. Since the patterning of metallic \\ninterconnects is done at the end of the chip fabrication process, the turn-around time can still be short, a few days to \\na few weeks. A corner of a gate array chip which contains bonding pads on its left and bottom edges, diodes for 1O \\nprotection, nMOS transistors and pMOS transistors for chip output driver circuits adjacent to bonding pads, arrays \\nof nMOS transistors and pMOS transistors,  underpass wire segments, and power and ground buses along with \\ncontact windows. The availability of these routing channels simplifies the interconnections, even using one metal \\nlayer only. Interconnection patterns that perform basic logic gates can be stored in a library, which can then be used \\nto customize rows of uncommitted transistors according to the netlist. \\n \\n'),\n",

The standard cell is also called the polycell. In this \\ndesign style, all of the commonly used logic cells are developed, characterized, and stored in a standard cell library. \\nA typical library may contain a few hundred cells including inverters, NAND gates, NOR gates, complex AOI, OAI \\ngates, D latches, and flip-flops. Each gate type can be implemented in several versions to provide adequate driving \\ncapability for different fan -outs. For instance, the inverter gate can have sta ndard size, double size, and quadruple \\nsize so that the chip designer can choose the proper size to achieve high circuit speed and layout density. Each cell is \\ncharacterized according to several different characte rization categories, including: Delay time versus lo ad \\ncapacitance, Circuit simulation model, Timing simulation model, Fault simulation model, Cell data for place -and-\\nroute, Mask data. To enable automated placement of the cells and routing of inter -cell connections, each cell layout \\nis designed with a fixed height, so that a number of cells can be abutted side -by-side to form rows. The power and \\nground rails typically run parallel to the upper and lower boundaries of the cell, thus, neighboring cells share a \\ncommon power and ground bus. The input and output pins are located on the upper and lower boundaries of the cell.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFull Custom Design \\nAlthough the standard -cells based design style is sometimes called full custom design, in a strict sense, it is \\nsomewhat less than fully customized since the cells are pre -designed for general use and the same cells are utilized \\n'),\n",

In a truly full-custom design, the entire mask design is done anew without use of any \\nlibrary. However, the development cost of such a design style is becoming prohibitively high. Thus, the concept of \\ndesign reuse is becoming popular in order to reduce design cycle time and development cost. The most rigorous full \\ncustom design can be the design of a memory cell, be it static or dynamic. Since the same layout design is \\nreplicated, there would not be any alternative to high density memory chip design. F or logic chip design, a good \\ncompromise can be achieved by using a combination of different design styles on the same chip, such as standard \\ncells, data -path cells and programmable logic arrays (PLAs). In real full -custom layout in which the geometry, \\norientation and placement of every transistor is done individually by the designer, design productivity is usually very \\nlow - typically a few tens of transistors per day, per designer. In digital CMOS VLSI, full -custom design is rarely \\nused due to the high lab or cost. Exceptions to this include the design of high -volume products such as memory \\nchips, high-performance microprocessors and FPGA masters.

Performance is high since the components switch quickly and \\nconsume little power (compared to their discrete counterparts) because the components are small and \\npositioned close together.

This is indicated in the Figure 1.9 (c). \\n(d) This is followed by covering the surface of substrate with a thin, high-quality oxide layer, which \\nwill eventually form the gate oxide of the \\nMOS transistor as illustrated in Figure 1.9 (d). \\n(e) On top of the thin oxide, a layer of polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon) is deposited as is shown in \\nthe Figure 1.9 (e). Polysilicon is used both as gate electrode material for MOS transistors and also as \\nan interconnect medium in silicon integrated circuits. Undoped p olysilicon has relatively high \\nresistivity. The resistivity of polysilicon can be reduced, however, by doping it with impurity atoms. \\n(f) After deposition, the polysilicon layer is patterned and etched to form the interconnects and the \\nMOS transistor gates. This is shown in Figure 1.9 (f). \\n(g) The thin gate oxide not covered by polysilicon is also etched along, which exposes the bare', 'silicon surface on which the source and drain junctions are to be formed (Figure 1.9 (g)). \\n(h) The entire silicon surface is then doped with high concentration of impurities, either through \\ndiffusion or ion implantation (in this case with donor atoms to produce n -type doping). Diffusion is \\nachieved by heating the wafer to a high temperature and passing the gas containing desired impurities \\nover the surface. Figure 1.9 (h) shows that the doping penetrates the exposed areas on the silicon \\nsurface, ultimately creating two n -type regions (source and drain junctions) in the p -type substrate. \\nThe impurity doping also penetrates the polysilicon on the surface, reducing its resistivity. \\n(i) Once the source and drain regions are completed, the entire surface is again covered with an \\ninsulating layer of silicon dioxide, as shown in \\nFigure 1.9 (i).(j) The insulating oxide layer is then patterned in order to provide contact windows for \\nthe drain and source junctions, as illustrated in Figure 1.9 (j).']\n",

Therefore, a set of layout rules, al so called design \\nrules, has been defined.

The objective associated with \\nlayout rules is to obtain a circuit with optimum yi eld (functional circuits versus non -functional \\ncircuits) in as small as area possible without compromising reliability of the circuit. In addition, \\nDesign rules can be conservative or aggressive, depending on whether yield or performance is \\ndesired. Generally, they are a compromise between the two. Manufacturing processes have their \\ninherent limitations in accuracy. So the need of design rules arises due to manufacturing \\nproblems like – \\n• Photo resist shrinkage, tearing. \\n• Variations in material deposition, temperature and oxide thickness. \\n• Impurities. \\n• Variations across a wafer. \\nThese lead to various problems like : \\n• Transistor problems: \\nVariations in threshold voltage: This may occur due to variations in oxide thickness, ion - \\nimplantation and poly layer.

Generally, data is arranged to flow in one direction, while control signals \\nare introduced in a direction orthogonal to the dataflow. Common data  path operators include adders, one/zero \\ndetectors, comparators, counters, Boolean logic units, error-correcting code blocks, shifters, and multipliers. \\n \\nAdder: Addition forms the basis for many processing operatio ns, from ALUs to address genera tion to \\nmultiplication to filtering.

Such a full adder has a third input called C or Cin.', 'N-bit adders take inputs {AN, ..., A1}, {BN, ..., B1}, and carry -in Cin, and compute the sum  {SN, ..., S1} and the \\ncarry-out of the most significant bit Cout .

Each \\ndesign style has its own merits and shortcomings, and thus a proper choice has to be made by designers in order to \\nprovide the specified functionality at low cost and in a timely manner. \\n \\n Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)  Fully fabricated FPGA chips containing thousands or even more, of \\nlogic gates with programmable interconnects, are available to users for their custom hardware programming to \\nrealize desired functionality. This design style provides a means for fast prototyping and also for cost-effective chip \\ndesign, especially for low-volume applications. A typical field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip consists of I/O \\nbuffers, an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs), and programmable interconnect structures. The programming \\nof the interconnects is accomplished by programming of RAM cells whose output terminals are connected to the \\ngates of MOS pass transistors.

While user programming is central to the design implementation of the \\nFPGA chip, metal mask design and processing is used for GA. Gate ar ray implementation requires a two -step \\nmanufacturing process: The first phase, which is based on generic (standard) masks, results in an array of \\nuncommitted transistors on each GA chip. These uncommitted chips can be stored for later customization, which is \\ncompleted by defining the metal interconnects between the trans istors of the array. Since the patterning of metallic \\ninterconnects is done at the end of the chip fabrication process, the turn-around time can still be short, a few days to \\na few weeks.

The availability of these routing channels simplifies the interconnections, even using one metal \\nlayer only.

In this \\ndesign style, all of the commonly used logic cells are developed, characterized, and stored in a standard cell library. \\nA typical library may contain a few hundred cells including inverters, NAND gates, NOR gates, complex AOI, OAI \\ngates, D latches, and flip-flops. Each gate type can be implemented in several versions to provide adequate driving \\ncapability for different fan -outs. For instance, the inverter gate can have sta ndard size, double size, and quadruple \\nsize so that the chip designer can choose the proper size to achieve high circuit speed and layout density. Each cell is \\ncharacterized according to several different characte rization categories, including: Delay time versus lo ad \\ncapacitance, Circuit simulation model, Timing simulation model, Fault simulation model, Cell data for place -and-\\nroute, Mask data. To enable automated placement of the cells and routing of inter -cell connections, each cell layout \\nis designed with a fixed height, so that a number of cells can be abutted side -by-side to form rows.

The most rigorous full \\ncustom design can be the design of a memory cell, be it static or dynamic.
