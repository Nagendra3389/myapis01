It originally grew the biomass that\\nwe now access as fossil fuels. Other sources include tidal, geothermal and\\nnuclear.1 The sun’s energy comes from fusion reactions in its core. These\\nreactions have been “burning” for 4.5 billion years and are expected to\\ncontinue for another 6.5 billion years. The total power radiated out into\\nspace by the sun is about 3 .86 × 1026 W. Since the sun is approximately\\n1.5 × 1011 m from the earth, and because the earth is about 6.3 × 106 mi n\\nradius, it intercepts only 0.000000045% of this power. 2 This still amounts\\nto a massive 1.75 × 1017 W.\\nMost of this radiation is in the visible and infrared part of the electro-\\nmagnetic spectrum, with less than 1% emitted in the radio, UV and X-ray\\nspectral bands.\\nThe sun’s electromagnetic radiation approximates that of a black body\\nwith a temperature around 5778K, with its peak in the yellow range of the\\nvisible spectrum.

Solar energy generally oﬀers very low risk to pub-\\nlic or operator safety and therefore, the location of solar energy plants can\\nbe ﬂexible. Its use at large industrial scales is believed to be environmentally\\nbenign.\\nWhere it is accessible through relatively clear skies, sunlight may be\\nconcentrated up to a theoretical maximum of 46,300 times. 29 This corre-\\nsponds to catching all the light leaving a unit area of the solar surface and\\ngenerating its optical image on the surface of a terrestrial absorber, which\\nwould require a vast elliptical reﬂector with the sun and the earth at the\\nfoci. Note that while this book is concerned with solar energy, ultimately\\nit is exergy, a measure of the useful work it is possible to extract from an\\nenergy ﬂow, that is of greater interest. 29 Higher concentration of sunlight\\npermits lower exergy destruction in conversion stages so it allows more eﬃ-\\ncient conversion of solar energy to useful forms such as mechanical work,\\nelectricity, chemical fuels or high-temperature process heat. Conversion of\\nnon- or low-concentrated solar radiation has less strict requirements for\\ndynamic alignment of the collectors towards the sun, as compared with\\nconcentrating solar applications, and such types of photovoltaic or solar\\nthermal receivers are appropriate for urban installation. Many forms of\\nsolar energy conversion are small in scale and modular, so there are low\\nbarriers to incremental introduction.\\nOn the other hand, solar energy also has disadvantages. It is much\\nmore diﬀuse than, for example, fossil or nuclear fuels, so large surface areas\\nare required to collect large quantities of energy. At any given location on\\nearth, the intensity and spectrum of sunlight varies in both predictable\\nand less predictable ways, introducing intermittency of supply.

Technical responses\\nto intermittency30 include using solar energy as a “fuel saver” in fossil fueled\\nnetworks, hybridization of systems with multiple solar or other renewable or\\nnon-renewable sources, coupled energy storage, the topic of another volume\\nin this series, and the proposed collection of solar energy from orbiting\\npower stations that then transmit to earth.31 Some forms of solar energy\\ncollection and conversion, such as biomass and the domestic solar water\\nheater, are relatively easily coupled to storage but it can be expensive and\\ndiﬃcult for other forms.\\nAnother disadvantage is geographic speciﬁcity. Economic introduction\\nof solar energy to existing energy distribution systems needs to conform\\nto existing infrastructure that was built around competing energy sources.\\nFor example, the optimal location of large extra-urban solar power stations\\nrequires access to existing electricity grid infrastructure with capacity to\\naccept the solar supply, collocated with available, un-conﬂicted and low-\\ncost land and high solar radiation.\\nFinally, there is a large array of solar energy conversion technologies,\\nsome simple and some technically complex, that, while together competing\\nwith established fossil and nuclear energy, also compete with each other.\\nResearchers in all areas oﬀer promise of better, cheaper technologies.

In the\\ncase of the Roman Empire, the architect Vitruvius recommended diﬀerent\\npassive solar building designs for diﬀerent latitudes, outlining principles\\nthat are still applied today. Solar access rights for buildings were included\\nin the Justinian Code of law in the sixth century AD. Both ancient Greek\\nand Chinese cultures developed concentrating solar reﬂectors to generate\\nhigh temperature ignition for religious, civil and military purposes. “Burn-\\ning mirrors” have since then been designed and used by many cultures\\nthrough the centuries. Glazed heat traps in buildings were developed by\\nthe Romans and the idea was revived much later in Europe as the conser-\\nvatory or greenhouse for horticulture of plants outside their natural ranges\\nor out of season.\\nThe commercial availability of the Climax Solar Water Heater at the\\nend of the 19th century in the USA initiated the mass availability of aﬀord-\\nable solar domestic heating of water that has continued to drive the devel-\\nopment of ﬂat plate and evacuated tube heaters ever since. The harnessing\\nof the sun for mechanical power began at least as early as the 1st century\\nAD with solar water syphons built in Alexandria. The invention of the ﬁrst\\nsolar steam engine has been attributed to Augustin Mouchot in France in\\n1866. He went on to develop solar cooking ovens and solar thermoelectric\\ngenerators. The early 20th century saw an explosion of applications for\\nsolar engines for water pumping and other remote energy applications in\\nthe American west and elsewhere.40\\nThree main forms of concentrator have been developed to generate\\neither high temperatures in solar thermal collectors or high conversion eﬃ-\\nciencies in photovoltaic collectors: parabolic troughs that focus light onto a', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It was not until\\n1914 that Goldmann and Brodsky 43 made a photoelectric interpretation.\\nIn the 1870s, William Gryllis Adams and R.E. Day investigated “whether it\\nwould be possible to start a current in the selenium merely by the action of\\nlight”. The result was positive, “ clearly proving that by the action of light\\nalone we could start and maintain an electrical current in the selenium”.\\nThey did not, however, understand the processes at work in their devices,\\nexplaining the voltage as being due to extra light-induced crystallization\\nin the material. Charles Fritts44 foresaw great potential for solar power\\nfrom selenium photovoltaics. There were at least four American manufac-\\nturers of selenium photovoltaic cells by 1949. Copper–cuprous oxide cells\\nwere also under investigation since 1917 45 and there was intense rivalry\\nbetween groups in Germany and USA through the 1920s, when copper-\\nbased cells were commercialized.

We introduce a range of them in this section before they are\\ntreated in detail in the following chapters.\\n4.1 Photovoltaics for Large-Scale Electricity Production\\nPhotovoltaics have undergone continual development in the decades since\\n1950s until silicon and cadmium telluride photovoltaics now present a cred-\\nible challenge to fossil fuels and are one of the most promising methods\\nto continue to provide electrical services to society in a carbon-challenged\\nworld. Government support programs for photovoltaics integration into\\nelectricity grids, most importantly and eﬀectively in Japan and then\\nGermany in the late 20th century, initiated the recent boom in demand\\nand consequent mass production. Research associated with those programs\\nsolved the major safety concern about potential creation of live “islands”\\nin otherwise closed grids and power quality and utility scale photovoltaics\\ninstallations sprang up in many countries to compete with the incumbent\\nwholesale electricity generators (see Fig. 4). The output of these systems\\nis not associated with particular consumers. These systems are normally\\n24 ground-mounted and independent of nearby activities. The International\\nEnergy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) 46\\ntracks the diﬀerent categories of installations in its 24 member countries.\\nSuch systems have been particularly popular in China and USA, where\\ntheir installed new capacity exceeds that for decentralized grid connected\\nsystems. The main market for utility scale systems has shifted from Europe\\nto Asia in recent years.\\nPerhaps the most signiﬁcant challenge to future growth of this mar-\\nket segment is the growing resistance of electricity utilities and inﬂuential\\nincumbent generators. Costs of large systems are generally lower than for\\nsmall distributed systems but they also compete for a lower price product,\\nbulk, wholesale electricity.

These\\nsystems, commonly on building roofs, can connect on the customer side of\\nconsumption meters and avoid the purchase of electricity from utilities and\\nthreaten their traditional business models (Fig. 5). Costs of these systems\\nare generally higher than for utility scale systems due to their smaller scale\\nbut they compete at the retail price level. In many markets, such systems\\nnow need to be designed for self-consumption of their output, avoiding\\nexport to the grid, to make them economical. This is generally easier and\\nmore valuable for commercial than for domestic loads since they tend to\\nbe predominantly daytime demand. These are the types of systems that\\nwere facilitated by the Japanese and German support schemes and their\\nfollowers in other countries and the IEA PVPS records show that the grid-\\nconnected market worldwide has evolved from dominance of distributed\\nsystems to roughly half utility scale now.

Water pump-\\ning systems commonly operate without batteries or backup. These markets\\nhave not gone away but now attract less attention because of the great\\nincrease in the mass grid-connected demand, which now dwarfs the earlier\\nmarkets.46\\n4.4 Concentrating Solar Thermal Electricity\\nThe concentration of the incident solar ﬂux, for either photovoltaics or\\nconcentrating solar thermal (CST) technologies, is limited to regions with\\nconsistently high, direct, solar irradiation. This implies a separation from\\nmany of the areas where people have chosen to congregate in the world.\\nIt also demands mechanical tracking of collectors to keep them pointed\\nat the sun, with consequent reliability concerns. CST technologies have\\nhad a much more positive history than has concentrating photovoltaics\\nand several installations have been built in Spain and the USA.48 Other\\ncountries including China, India, and Australia have also built CST plants\\nmainly on a test basis and the world has approximately 3800 MW capacity\\nin operation with more than double that in the pipeline. The economics are\\ncurrently not as attractive as those of ﬂat plate photovoltaics but CST has\\nthe distinct advantage of easy coupling to relatively inexpensive storage, as\\nsensible or latent heat or in thermochemical conversion (see next section).\\nIntegrated storage oﬀers “dispatchable” energy, available on demand.\\nOne of the main uses for CST is the generation of high temper-\\natures to drive turbines for electricity generation, in both stand-alone\\nsolar power plants and as a fuel-saving adjunct to existing fossil-fueled\\npower stations. Others are to drive industrial processes directly, facili-\\ntate endothermic chemical reactions (see Chapter 9), and provide cooling\\nservices. Higher concentrations are required for higher temperatures and\\nconversion eﬃciencies.\\nLinear parabolic trough reﬂectors or Fresnel lenses, dishes and power\\ntowers are all used.49 Linear focusing collectors with single-axis solar track-\\ning, in north-south rows, generate medium temperatures, around 400◦Ca n d\\norganic Rankine cycle turbines convert the energy to a rotating mechanical\\nform to spin a generator.

The\\nworking ﬂuid transports the heat to a Rankine or Brayton cycle engine on\\nthe ground.\\nSolar thermal generation of electricity currently remains expensive rel-\\native to photovoltaics and to some fossil fuel technologies so it would seem\\nthat installations in the near term are likely to be restricted to clear-sky\\nsituations in which a premium for storage is justiﬁed. However, it remains\\nto be seen whether costs will come down signiﬁcantly with increasing expe-\\nrience and larger-scale production in China and India.\\n4.5 Solar Thermochemical Processes\\nOptions to reduce the impact of intermittency on concentrating solar ther-\\nmal plants are to store sensible or latent heat or to use it to drive endother-\\nmic thermochemical processes.50 The product chemicals can be transported\\nover long distances or stored and delivered to reformer reactors in which\\nheat is released in exothermic reactions. Alternatively, solar heat may be\\napplied to change the chemical composition of a fossil fuel to increase its\\ncaloriﬁc content or endothermic industrial chemical conversion processes\\nmay be directly utilized. These processes are likely to be applied only at\\nvery large scale, and are currently at a pre-commercial stage of develop-\\nment.51 This storage option has the advantage over sensible and latent heat\\nstorage since that storage is at ambient temperature. In the case of solar-\\nproduced fuels, signiﬁcant storage capacity may be aﬀorded by the volume\\nof existing reticulation systems at low cost. 51 A special class of processes\\nare those for production of commodities such as lime, cement, ammonia,\\nmetals, which are not obtained for energy storage purposes. However, sub-\\nstitution of conventional fossil-based process heat with solar heat in the\\nhighly-endothermic reactions allows for drastic reduction in fossil energy\\nuse, and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. There are a large number\\nof outstanding technical issues to be solved for this complex technology,\\nincluding reversibility, material discovery, stability and durability, reliabil-\\nity and eﬃciency of solar-driven reactors, and aspects associated with high-\\ntemperatures and transients.

Two main\\ncollector technologies are already in mass production: ﬂat plate and evacu-\\nated tube. In the former, the solar radiation heats a dark metal plate and\\nheat is transferred to either a heat transfer ﬂuid or directly to the water\\nitself. Except for very low temperature applications such as swimming pool\\nheating, an air gap and glazing above the plate allows higher temperatures to\\nbe generated by the greenhouse eﬀect (visible light passes through the glaz-\\ning to the plate while upwardly directed infrared radiation from the plate\\nis blocked by the glass). Performance may be further improved by the use\\nof spectrally “selective absorber” coatings on the plate that further limit\\nradiative losses. Circulation of the ﬂuid in contact with the plate can be\\ndriven by the thermosyphon eﬀect or by a pump if the storage tank cannot\\nbe mounted directly above the collector, as it is in the example in Fig. 5.\\nThe other main technology uses a double walled glass evacuated tube\\nin which the gap between the walls is evacuated to block heat loss by\\nconduction and convection.53 A spectrally selective coating is applied to the\\ninner wall or to a long, narrow absorber plate which allows a circulating\\nworking ﬂuid to be heated to higher temperatures than with ﬂat plates.\\nResearch into improved collectors includes the potential use of nanoﬂuids,\\nﬂuids with suspensions of nanoparticl es, for direct absorption of sunlight\\nby the working ﬂuid.\\nA third technology in widespread use is arguably deﬁned as a solar\\nwater heating technology. Domestic scale heat pump water heaters entered\\nthe mass market with ground mounted water storage tanks and roof-\\nmounted and sun-exposed panels to evaporate the working refrigerant. How-\\never, customer resistance to the high installation cost, including the need for\\nlicensed refrigeration tradesmen to install and certify the necessary refriger-\\nant pipework, led to the packaging of the evaporator panel wrapped around\\nthe tank, trading reduced performance for greater market acceptance.

This\\nis discussed further in Chapter 8.\\n4.8 Evaporative Cooling\\nLike domestic solar water heating, evaporative cooling is a solar technology\\nthat has achieved mass market acceptance and is sometimes overlooked as\\na contribution of solar energy to human comfort and convenience. Evapora-\\ntive cooling is a ubiquitous air conditioning choice in many of the less humid\\nclimate zones of the world. It works by using solar-heated ambient warmth\\nto extract heat from a fan-forced ﬂow of air by the latent heat of evapora-\\ntion of water. Even more simply, passive forms rely on prevailing wind to\\nblow air across ponds. It is the technology that supports the cooling towers\\nprevalent in commercial/industrial air conditioning and industrial cooling\\nand in fossil fueled and nuclear generation of electricity so it may be seen\\nthat evaporative cooling makes a huge contribution to human energy ser-\\nvices but is generally excluded from renewable energy statistics.\\nThe state of the art of evaporative cooling is described in Chapter 8 of\\nthis volume.\\n4.9 Biomass and Biofuels\\nModern application of biomass and biofuels encompasses a wide range of\\ntechnologies from eﬃcient cook stoves, mass-scale pelletization of wood and\\nwaste materials, the capture and combustion for electricity generation of\\nmethane from decaying municipal waste (landﬁll gas), to the highly techni-\\ncal production of liquid fuels from agricultural and forestry crops or wastes,\\norganic municipal waste, and cultivated algae for the subsequent extraction\\nof oil.\\nThe use of liquid biomass fuels has entered the mass market in some\\nregions of the world, most notably in Brazil with sugar-derived ethanol', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A report from a consultancy, Lazard, estimated\\nfor the US ranges of 0.18–0.265USD/kWh for rooftop residential installa-\\ntions, 0.126–0.177USD/KWh for commercial and industrial systems and\\n0.072–0.086USD/KWh for utility scale.32\\nCosts for concentrated solar thermal generated electricity are less well\\ndeﬁned since the market is still small and many projects are “proof of\\nconcept” or experimental. This technology shares with concentrated solar\\nphotovoltaics many barriers to reaching commercial markets, clearly out-\\nlined more than a decade ago including restriction to clear-sky regions\\nthat, commonly are remote from human habitation (although the energy\\ntransmission costs are at least partly balanced by low land cost), the lack\\nof markets for small-scale initial installations to build cash ﬂow, incon-\\nsistent government policies, negative perceptions, competition from ﬂat-\\nplate photovoltaics and direct competition from fossil fuel power plants.47\\nNevertheless, estimates for LCOE from solar thermal electricity are still\\nreasonably attractive and projected to fall. The Australian study men-\\ntioned above found that LCOE for solarthermal electricity without storage\\nwas in the range 0.21–0.35USD/kWh and slightly higher for systems with\\nstorage in 2012 (updated in 2013)63 and projected a very wide range on\\n0.05–0.26USD/kWh in 2050. However, the same study found that coupling\\nsolar thermal to existing fossil-fueled power plants as fuel savers oﬀers much\\nmore competitive prices.65 Another estimate, for the US, estimated LCOE\\nfor concentrated thermal electricity with storage at 0.118–0.13USD/kWh\\ncurrently.\\nLow temperature water heating has contributed massively to CO2 sav-\\nings, particularly in China and Europe. 66 The economics are complex,\\ndepending on solar radiation, water usage patterns, local energy prices,\\ngovernment support, type of solar water heater, etc. A comprehensive study', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Solar energy generally oﬀers very low risk to pub-\\nlic or operator safety and therefore, the location of solar energy plants can\\nbe ﬂexible. Its use at large industrial scales is believed to be environmentally\\nbenign.\\nWhere it is accessible through relatively clear skies, sunlight may be\\nconcentrated up to a theoretical maximum of 46,300 times. 29 This corre-\\nsponds to catching all the light leaving a unit area of the solar surface and\\ngenerating its optical image on the surface of a terrestrial absorber, which\\nwould require a vast elliptical reﬂector with the sun and the earth at the\\nfoci. Note that while this book is concerned with solar energy, ultimately\\nit is exergy, a measure of the useful work it is possible to extract from an\\nenergy ﬂow, that is of greater interest. 29 Higher concentration of sunlight\\npermits lower exergy destruction in conversion stages so it allows more eﬃ-\\ncient conversion of solar energy to useful forms such as mechanical work,\\nelectricity, chemical fuels or high-temperature process heat. Conversion of\\nnon- or low-concentrated solar radiation has less strict requirements for\\ndynamic alignment of the collectors towards the sun, as compared with\\nconcentrating solar applications, and such types of photovoltaic or solar\\nthermal receivers are appropriate for urban installation. Many forms of\\nsolar energy conversion are small in scale and modular, so there are low\\nbarriers to incremental introduction.\\nOn the other hand, solar energy also has disadvantages. It is much\\nmore diﬀuse than, for example, fossil or nuclear fuels, so large surface areas\\nare required to collect large quantities of energy. At any given location on\\nearth, the intensity and spectrum of sunlight varies in both predictable\\nand less predictable ways, introducing intermittency of supply.

It gives a high-level overview of the various\\nsolar energy capture and conversion technologies discussed in the book and\\nsummarizes the economics and policy aspects.\\n1 What is Solar Energy?\\nThe sun drives 99.98% of the world’s energy supply, 1 including thermal,\\nphotovoltaic, photochemical, photobiological and hybrid solar, hydro, wind,\\nwave, and biomass energy conversion. It originally grew the biomass that\\nwe now access as fossil fuels. Other sources include tidal, geothermal and\\nnuclear.1 The sun’s energy comes from fusion reactions in its core. These\\nreactions have been “burning” for 4.5 billion years and are expected to\\ncontinue for another 6.5 billion years. The total power radiated out into\\nspace by the sun is about 3 .86 × 1026 W. Since the sun is approximately\\n1.5 × 1011 m from the earth, and because the earth is about 6.3 × 106 mi n\\nradius, it intercepts only 0.000000045% of this power. 2 This still amounts\\nto a massive 1.75 × 1017 W.\\nMost of this radiation is in the visible and infrared part of the electro-\\nmagnetic spectrum, with less than 1% emitted in the radio, UV and X-ray\\nspectral bands.\\nThe sun’s electromagnetic radiation approximates that of a black body\\nwith a temperature around 5778K, with its peak in the yellow range of the\\nvisible spectrum. This is sometimes “rounded up” to 6000K for simplicity.3\\n1', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1812, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8532128471589471), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='4ae3f7d5-f215-451f-ba24-518b1bc4b10f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '26', 'file_name': '9637_chap01.pdf', 'file_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Win10\\\\Desktop\\\\data\\\\9637_chap01.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 639751, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-12'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='8bde7d18-9b49-4967-8e92-46e9178a177d', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '26', 'file_name': '9637_chap01.pdf', 'file_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Win10\\\\Desktop\\\\data\\\\9637_chap01.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 639751, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-12'}, hash='dff9f6605a04a89dfa750adb0a1d0042c0b36be22229fc3b6e3bedd0b3073be8')}, text='Introduction to Solar Energy 25\\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency has developed a set of\\npolicy directions to address these issues in diﬀerent contexts.\\n7 Summary/Conclusions\\nSolar energy is on the verge of a massive boom. Together with wind energy,\\nit directly challenges the incumbent dominant forms of traded energy, fos-\\nsil and nuclear. This chapter outlines the rapidly improving economics of\\nsolar energy, particularly, ﬂat-plate photovoltaics, in an inexorable march\\ntowards dominant market share as global concern grows about the impact\\nof atmospheric carbon on climate change. We are already seeing the begin-\\nnings of divestment of fossil fuelled energy by inﬂuential investors, as fears\\ngrow about stranded assets. The chapter also addresses the policy envi-\\nronment that has encouraged the development of solar energy in recent\\ndecades. However, some of these policies are under threat as energy com-\\npanies, especially in the areas of electri city transmission and distribution,\\nrealize the challenge posed by solar to their traditional business models and\\nlearn to adjust those models to include distributed generation.\\nThis volume describes the recent advances and current status of a\\nwide range of approaches to capturing and exploiting solar energy to serve\\nhumanity’s needs. It is a timely summary of the technologies becoming\\nmature and breaking into the current markets as well as those still in the\\nR&D realm. In spite of many challenges ahead, solar energy is likely to\\ndominate traded human energy soon, as it has always dominated untraded\\nenergy.\\nReferences\\n1. K. Hubbert, Sci.

The elevation varies the thickness of “air mass” through which\\nthe sunlight passes to reach the earth’s surface, aﬀecting its intensity and\\nspectrum. Less predictably, clouds and atmospheric aerosols, such as dust\\nand smoke, reduce intensity and modify the spectrum. Technical responses\\nto intermittency30 include using solar energy as a “fuel saver” in fossil fueled\\nnetworks, hybridization of systems with multiple solar or other renewable or\\nnon-renewable sources, coupled energy storage, the topic of another volume\\nin this series, and the proposed collection of solar energy from orbiting\\npower stations that then transmit to earth.31 Some forms of solar energy\\ncollection and conversion, such as biomass and the domestic solar water\\nheater, are relatively easily coupled to storage but it can be expensive and\\ndiﬃcult for other forms.\\nAnother disadvantage is geographic speciﬁcity. Economic introduction\\nof solar energy to existing energy distribution systems needs to conform\\nto existing infrastructure that was built around competing energy sources.\\nFor example, the optimal location of large extra-urban solar power stations\\nrequires access to existing electricity grid infrastructure with capacity to\\naccept the solar supply, collocated with available, un-conﬂicted and low-\\ncost land and high solar radiation.\\nFinally, there is a large array of solar energy conversion technologies,\\nsome simple and some technically complex, that, while together competing\\nwith established fossil and nuclear energy, also compete with each other.\\nResearchers in all areas oﬀer promise of better, cheaper technologies. Some\\ninvestors are bewildered by the range choice and refrain altogether, awaiting\\nclarity to avoid “betting on the wrong horse” and for the promised future\\ntechnologies to become available. However, great attention is now being\\npaid to this and good quality advice is available. 32,33 Some forms of solar\\nenergy conversion have traditionally been much more expensive than fossil\\nfuel use, so long as economic externalities are excluded, but, at least for\\nnon-concentrating photovoltaics, this is now changing.34 Funds are increas-\\ning ﬂowing out of the incumbent technologies and into solar.35 Large-scale\\nadoption of solar energy will necessarily require large amounts of de-risked\\ncapital, requiring the solar energy industries to pay great attention to sys-\\ntems quality and performance prediction and monitoring.\\n3 History of Solar Energy Use\\nSolar energy has long supported humanity, with at least two forms, pas-\\nsive solar energy and biomass fuel use.
