It gives a high-level overview of the various\\nsolar energy capture and conversion technologies discussed in the book and\\nsummarizes the economics and policy aspects.\\n1 What is Solar Energy?\\nThe sun drives 99.98% of the world’s energy supply, 1 including thermal,\\nphotovoltaic, photochemical, photobiological and hybrid solar, hydro, wind,\\nwave, and biomass energy conversion. It originally grew the biomass that\\nwe now access as fossil fuels. Other sources include tidal, geothermal and\\nnuclear.1 The sun’s energy comes from fusion reactions in its core. These\\nreactions have been “burning” for 4.5 billion years and are expected to\\ncontinue for another 6.5 billion years. The total power radiated out into\\nspace by the sun is about 3 .86 × 1026 W. Since the sun is approximately\\n1.5 × 1011 m from the earth, and because the earth is about 6.3 × 106 mi n\\nradius, it intercepts only 0.000000045% of this power. 2 This still amounts\\nto a massive 1.75 × 1017 W.\\nMost of this radiation is in the visible and infrared part of the electro-\\nmagnetic spectrum, with less than 1% emitted in the radio, UV and X-ray\\nspectral bands.\\nThe sun’s electromagnetic radiation approximates that of a black body\\nwith a temperature around 5778K, with its peak in the yellow range of the\\nvisible spectrum. This is sometimes “rounded up” to 6000K for simplicity.3\\n1'),\n",

About 29% is reﬂected\\nback to space by clouds, atmospheric particles or ground surfaces. About\\n23% of intercepted solar energy is absorbed in the atmosphere and 48%\\npasses through to be absorbed by the surface.15\\nThe geographical distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth’s\\nsurface is studied and monitored extensively and satellite-derived estimates\\nare available for the whole globe.16 Detailed mapping resources for USA\\nand Australia, for example, are provided by the National Renewable Energy\\nLaboratory17 and the Bureau of Meteorology. 18 Free online maps for the\\nworld and many of its regions are provided by SolarGIS.19\\nAs might be expected, there tends to be less solar radiation towards\\nthe poles and cloudiness around the equator reduces the radiation reaching\\nthe ground there, leading to the regions of highest insolation being found\\nin the high tropical and low temperate latitudes.\\nMeasurements of solar radiation are made at many sites globally20 with\\ncalibrated pyrheliometers,21 the most sophisticated of which use shadow\\nbands to measure separately the diﬀuse and direct components. Histori-\\ncal data and long-term averages are available through various databases,\\nincluding the World Radiation Data Centre22 and the World Radiation\\nMonitoring Center (WRMC), which maintain the central archive of the\\nBaseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN).23 The directly measured data\\nis of limited use to engineers to design solar energy collection systems and\\nit undergoes considerable processing to generate useful formats such as typ-\\nical meteorological year (TMY) or monthly average daily global radiation\\non a horizontal surface.24\\nAdditionally, solar radiation is estimated from satellite-based instru-\\nments.25,26 For example, the NASA Atmospheric Science Data Center 16\\nprovides long-term estimates of surface solar energy ﬂux for 1 ◦ longitude\\nby 1◦ latitude grid covering the entire globe.

Solar energy generally oﬀers very low risk to pub-\\nlic or operator safety and therefore, the location of solar energy plants can\\nbe ﬂexible. Its use at large industrial scales is believed to be environmentally\\nbenign.\\nWhere it is accessible through relatively clear skies, sunlight may be\\nconcentrated up to a theoretical maximum of 46,300 times. 29 This corre-\\nsponds to catching all the light leaving a unit area of the solar surface and\\ngenerating its optical image on the surface of a terrestrial absorber, which\\nwould require a vast elliptical reﬂector with the sun and the earth at the\\nfoci. Note that while this book is concerned with solar energy, ultimately\\nit is exergy, a measure of the useful work it is possible to extract from an\\nenergy ﬂow, that is of greater interest. 29 Higher concentration of sunlight\\npermits lower exergy destruction in conversion stages so it allows more eﬃ-\\ncient conversion of solar energy to useful forms such as mechanical work,\\nelectricity, chemical fuels or high-temperature process heat. Conversion of\\nnon- or low-concentrated solar radiation has less strict requirements for\\ndynamic alignment of the collectors towards the sun, as compared with\\nconcentrating solar applications, and such types of photovoltaic or solar\\nthermal receivers are appropriate for urban installation. Many forms of\\nsolar energy conversion are small in scale and modular, so there are low\\nbarriers to incremental introduction.\\nOn the other hand, solar energy also has disadvantages. It is much\\nmore diﬀuse than, for example, fossil or nuclear fuels, so large surface areas\\nare required to collect large quantities of energy. At any given location on\\nearth, the intensity and spectrum of sunlight varies in both predictable\\nand less predictable ways, introducing intermittency of supply. The tilt of\\nthe earth’s axis means seasonal changes in solar radiation availability, with\\nchanges in the extent of daylight an d the apparent elevation of the sun'),\n",

The elevation varies the thickness of “air mass” through which\\nthe sunlight passes to reach the earth’s surface, aﬀecting its intensity and\\nspectrum. Less predictably, clouds and atmospheric aerosols, such as dust\\nand smoke, reduce intensity and modify the spectrum. Technical responses\\nto intermittency30 include using solar energy as a “fuel saver” in fossil fueled\\nnetworks, hybridization of systems with multiple solar or other renewable or\\nnon-renewable sources, coupled energy storage, the topic of another volume\\nin this series, and the proposed collection of solar energy from orbiting\\npower stations that then transmit to earth.31 Some forms of solar energy\\ncollection and conversion, such as biomass and the domestic solar water\\nheater, are relatively easily coupled to storage but it can be expensive and\\ndiﬃcult for other forms.\\nAnother disadvantage is geographic speciﬁcity. Economic introduction\\nof solar energy to existing energy distribution systems needs to conform\\nto existing infrastructure that was built around competing energy sources.\\nFor example, the optimal location of large extra-urban solar power stations\\nrequires access to existing electricity grid infrastructure with capacity to\\naccept the solar supply, collocated with available, un-conﬂicted and low-\\ncost land and high solar radiation.\\nFinally, there is a large array of solar energy conversion technologies,\\nsome simple and some technically complex, that, while together competing\\nwith established fossil and nuclear energy, also compete with each other.\\nResearchers in all areas oﬀer promise of better, cheaper technologies. Some\\ninvestors are bewildered by the range choice and refrain altogether, awaiting\\nclarity to avoid “betting on the wrong horse” and for the promised future\\ntechnologies to become available. However, great attention is now being\\npaid to this and good quality advice is available. 32,33 Some forms of solar\\nenergy conversion have traditionally been much more expensive than fossil\\nfuel use, so long as economic externalities are excluded, but, at least for\\nnon-concentrating photovoltaics, this is now changing.34 Funds are increas-\\ning ﬂowing out of the incumbent technologies and into solar.35 Large-scale\\nadoption of solar energy will necessarily require large amounts of de-risked\\ncapital, requiring the solar energy industries to pay great attention to sys-\\ntems quality and performance prediction and monitoring.\\n3 History of Solar Energy Use\\nSolar energy has long supported humanity, with at least two forms, pas-\\nsive solar energy and biomass fuel use.

The growth of agriculture\\nin the sunny “cradle of civilization” played a critical role in the develop-\\nment of civilization.36 People have used the sun for drying crops, bricks,\\netc. since prehistoric times. The ﬁrst known crop drying installation has\\nbeen found in France and dates from around 8000 BC.37 There is evi-\\ndence from around the world of dryer development in many civilizations\\nand this relatively simple solar technology continues to change lives and\\neconomies for the better, even today, in remote locations all over the\\nplanet.38\\nThe US Department of Energy timeline provides a series of important\\nhistorical milestones for solar energy.39 Butti and Perlin40 describe that his-\\ntory, beginning with ancient classical Greek and Roman over-consumption\\nof biomass and including the passive solar dwelling and city design. In the\\ncase of the Roman Empire, the architect Vitruvius recommended diﬀerent\\npassive solar building designs for diﬀerent latitudes, outlining principles\\nthat are still applied today. Solar access rights for buildings were included\\nin the Justinian Code of law in the sixth century AD. Both ancient Greek\\nand Chinese cultures developed concentrating solar reﬂectors to generate\\nhigh temperature ignition for religious, civil and military purposes. “Burn-\\ning mirrors” have since then been designed and used by many cultures\\nthrough the centuries. Glazed heat traps in buildings were developed by\\nthe Romans and the idea was revived much later in Europe as the conser-\\nvatory or greenhouse for horticulture of plants outside their natural ranges\\nor out of season.\\nThe commercial availability of the Climax Solar Water Heater at the\\nend of the 19th century in the USA initiated the mass availability of aﬀord-\\nable solar domestic heating of water that has continued to drive the devel-\\nopment of ﬂat plate and evacuated tube heaters ever since. The harnessing\\nof the sun for mechanical power began at least as early as the 1st century\\nAD with solar water syphons built in Alexandria. The invention of the ﬁrst\\nsolar steam engine has been attributed to Augustin Mouchot in France in\\n1866. He went on to develop solar cooking ovens and solar thermoelectric\\ngenerators. The early 20th century saw an explosion of applications for\\nsolar engines for water pumping and other remote energy applications in\\nthe American west and elsewhere.40\\nThree main forms of concentrator have been developed to generate\\neither high temperatures in solar thermal collectors or high conversion eﬃ-\\nciencies in photovoltaic collectors: parabolic troughs that focus light onto a'),\n",

Concentrating solar\\npower has been developed signiﬁcantly since the oil shocks of the 1970s,\\nprincipally in the US, Spain, Australia, and Israel. “Solar One”, a 10 MW\\ncentral-receiver demonstration project which opened in the US in 1982,\\nwas the ﬁrst of several large solar concentrators constructed in the modern\\nphase of growth to establish feasibility. It generated steam to drive a tur-\\nbine for electricity generation. Solar One was expanded and upgraded to\\nSolar Two in 1995, including molten salt thermal energy storage.\\nThere are several good histories documenting the beginnings of photo-\\nvoltaics, among them that by Crossleyet al.41 The French scientist Edmond\\nBecquerel discovered the photovoltaic eﬀect in an experimental photoelec-\\ntrochemical setup in 1839.42 At that time it was not possible to distin-\\nguish between chemical and photoelectric eﬀects and the explanation of\\nthese experiments was originally in terms of chemistry. It was not until\\n1914 that Goldmann and Brodsky 43 made a photoelectric interpretation.\\nIn the 1870s, William Gryllis Adams and R.E. Day investigated “whether it\\nwould be possible to start a current in the selenium merely by the action of\\nlight”. The result was positive, “ clearly proving that by the action of light\\nalone we could start and maintain an electrical current in the selenium”.\\nThey did not, however, understand the processes at work in their devices,\\nexplaining the voltage as being due to extra light-induced crystallization\\nin the material. Charles Fritts44 foresaw great potential for solar power\\nfrom selenium photovoltaics. There were at least four American manufac-\\nturers of selenium photovoltaic cells by 1949. Copper–cuprous oxide cells\\nwere also under investigation since 1917 45 and there was intense rivalry\\nbetween groups in Germany and USA through the 1920s, when copper-\\nbased cells were commercialized. The photovoltaic eﬀect was found in ger-\\nmanium in 1944 in USA but all of these materials were eclipsed by the\\nsuccess of silicon as a photovoltaic material. Russel Ohl of Bell Laborato-\\nries ﬁled patents in 1941 that were granted in 1946 and 1948 for the p–n\\njunction photovoltaic eﬀect in silicon and markets gradually grew for terres-\\ntrial and space applications. Silicon underpinned the development of serious\\nand signiﬁcant application of photovoltaics but cells based on alternative\\nmaterials, cadmium–telluride, copper–indium–gallium–diselenide and III-V\\nsemiconductors (i.e. compounds of elements from Groups III and V of the\\nPeriodic Table), have also been developed and commercialized in the late\\n20th century.'),\n",

Outputs\\ninclude low grade heat, high temperature industrial process heat, hydrogen,\\nsynthesis gas, synthetic hydrocarbons and other chemical energy carriers\\nsuch as ammonia and metals, and intermittent or dispatchable electricity.\\nThese technologies are all at diﬀerent developmental stages and associated\\ncost of energy. We introduce a range of them in this section before they are\\ntreated in detail in the following chapters.\\n4.1 Photovoltaics for Large-Scale Electricity Production\\nPhotovoltaics have undergone continual development in the decades since\\n1950s until silicon and cadmium telluride photovoltaics now present a cred-\\nible challenge to fossil fuels and are one of the most promising methods\\nto continue to provide electrical services to society in a carbon-challenged\\nworld. Government support programs for photovoltaics integration into\\nelectricity grids, most importantly and eﬀectively in Japan and then\\nGermany in the late 20th century, initiated the recent boom in demand\\nand consequent mass production. Research associated with those programs\\nsolved the major safety concern about potential creation of live “islands”\\nin otherwise closed grids and power quality and utility scale photovoltaics\\ninstallations sprang up in many countries to compete with the incumbent\\nwholesale electricity generators (see Fig. 4). The output of these systems\\nis not associated with particular consumers. These systems are normally\\n24 ground-mounted and independent of nearby activities. The International\\nEnergy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA PVPS) 46\\ntracks the diﬀerent categories of installations in its 24 member countries.\\nSuch systems have been particularly popular in China and USA, where\\ntheir installed new capacity exceeds that for decentralized grid connected\\nsystems. The main market for utility scale systems has shifted from Europe\\nto Asia in recent years.\\nPerhaps the most signiﬁcant challenge to future growth of this mar-\\nket segment is the growing resistance of electricity utilities and inﬂuential\\nincumbent generators. Costs of large systems are generally lower than for\\nsmall distributed systems but they also compete for a lower price product,\\nbulk, wholesale electricity. Concentrating photovoltaics technologies have\\ncontinued to struggle for a signiﬁcant market share for a range of well-\\nknown reasons.47 See Chapter 3 for an in-depth discussion of large-scale\\nphotovoltaics.'),\n",

These\\nsystems, commonly on building roofs, can connect on the customer side of\\nconsumption meters and avoid the purchase of electricity from utilities and\\nthreaten their traditional business models (Fig. 5). Costs of these systems\\nare generally higher than for utility scale systems due to their smaller scale\\nbut they compete at the retail price level. In many markets, such systems\\nnow need to be designed for self-consumption of their output, avoiding\\nexport to the grid, to make them economical. This is generally easier and\\nmore valuable for commercial than for domestic loads since they tend to\\nbe predominantly daytime demand. These are the types of systems that\\nwere facilitated by the Japanese and German support schemes and their\\nfollowers in other countries and the IEA PVPS records show that the grid-\\nconnected market worldwide has evolved from dominance of distributed\\nsystems to roughly half utility scale now. The situation is patchy across the\\nworld though, with conditions in some countries favoring small systems.'),\n",

The main applications for the smaller sys-\\ntems, up to 1 kW, were and are water pumps, lighting and remote homes\\nwhile those for larger installations were and are for commercial or indus-\\ntrial applications such as telecommunications repeaters, pastoral or mining'),\n",

In oﬀ-grid systems, pho-\\ntovoltaic modules are commonly connected through a charge controller to\\na battery and backup generation is also often incorporated. Water pump-\\ning systems commonly operate without batteries or backup. These markets\\nhave not gone away but now attract less attention because of the great\\nincrease in the mass grid-connected demand, which now dwarfs the earlier\\nmarkets.46\\n4.4 Concentrating Solar Thermal Electricity\\nThe concentration of the incident solar ﬂux, for either photovoltaics or\\nconcentrating solar thermal (CST) technologies, is limited to regions with\\nconsistently high, direct, solar irradiation. This implies a separation from\\nmany of the areas where people have chosen to congregate in the world.\\nIt also demands mechanical tracking of collectors to keep them pointed\\nat the sun, with consequent reliability concerns. CST technologies have\\nhad a much more positive history than has concentrating photovoltaics\\nand several installations have been built in Spain and the USA.48 Other\\ncountries including China, India, and Australia have also built CST plants\\nmainly on a test basis and the world has approximately 3800 MW capacity\\nin operation with more than double that in the pipeline. The economics are\\ncurrently not as attractive as those of ﬂat plate photovoltaics but CST has\\nthe distinct advantage of easy coupling to relatively inexpensive storage, as\\nsensible or latent heat or in thermochemical conversion (see next section).\\nIntegrated storage oﬀers “dispatchable” energy, available on demand.\\nOne of the main uses for CST is the generation of high temper-\\natures to drive turbines for electricity generation, in both stand-alone\\nsolar power plants and as a fuel-saving adjunct to existing fossil-fueled\\npower stations. Others are to drive industrial processes directly, facili-\\ntate endothermic chemical reactions (see Chapter 9), and provide cooling\\nservices. Higher concentrations are required for higher temperatures and\\nconversion eﬃciencies.\\nLinear parabolic trough reﬂectors or Fresnel lenses, dishes and power\\ntowers are all used.49 Linear focusing collectors with single-axis solar track-\\ning, in north-south rows, generate medium temperatures, around 400◦Ca n d\\norganic Rankine cycle turbines convert the energy to a rotating mechanical\\nform to spin a generator. Paraboloidal dishes and centralized power tow-\\ners need dual axis tracking and commonly have higher concentration ratios\\nand, hence, higher temperatures.

The\\nworking ﬂuid transports the heat to a Rankine or Brayton cycle engine on\\nthe ground.\\nSolar thermal generation of electricity currently remains expensive rel-\\native to photovoltaics and to some fossil fuel technologies so it would seem\\nthat installations in the near term are likely to be restricted to clear-sky\\nsituations in which a premium for storage is justiﬁed. However, it remains\\nto be seen whether costs will come down signiﬁcantly with increasing expe-\\nrience and larger-scale production in China and India.\\n4.5 Solar Thermochemical Processes\\nOptions to reduce the impact of intermittency on concentrating solar ther-\\nmal plants are to store sensible or latent heat or to use it to drive endother-\\nmic thermochemical processes.50 The product chemicals can be transported\\nover long distances or stored and delivered to reformer reactors in which\\nheat is released in exothermic reactions. Alternatively, solar heat may be\\napplied to change the chemical composition of a fossil fuel to increase its\\ncaloriﬁc content or endothermic industrial chemical conversion processes\\nmay be directly utilized. These processes are likely to be applied only at\\nvery large scale, and are currently at a pre-commercial stage of develop-\\nment.51 This storage option has the advantage over sensible and latent heat\\nstorage since that storage is at ambient temperature. In the case of solar-\\nproduced fuels, signiﬁcant storage capacity may be aﬀorded by the volume\\nof existing reticulation systems at low cost. 51 A special class of processes\\nare those for production of commodities such as lime, cement, ammonia,\\nmetals, which are not obtained for energy storage purposes. However, sub-\\nstitution of conventional fossil-based process heat with solar heat in the\\nhighly-endothermic reactions allows for drastic reduction in fossil energy\\nuse, and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. There are a large number\\nof outstanding technical issues to be solved for this complex technology,\\nincluding reversibility, material discovery, stability and durability, reliabil-\\nity and eﬃciency of solar-driven reactors, and aspects associated with high-\\ntemperatures and transients. These technologies are discussed in Chapter 9.\\n4.6 Solar Water Heating\\nSolar water heating, both domestic and commercial/industrial, is so com-\\nmon and mainstream in many regions of today’s world that it is sometimes'),\n",

Two main\\ncollector technologies are already in mass production: ﬂat plate and evacu-\\nated tube. In the former, the solar radiation heats a dark metal plate and\\nheat is transferred to either a heat transfer ﬂuid or directly to the water\\nitself. Except for very low temperature applications such as swimming pool\\nheating, an air gap and glazing above the plate allows higher temperatures to\\nbe generated by the greenhouse eﬀect (visible light passes through the glaz-\\ning to the plate while upwardly directed infrared radiation from the plate\\nis blocked by the glass). Performance may be further improved by the use\\nof spectrally “selective absorber” coatings on the plate that further limit\\nradiative losses. Circulation of the ﬂuid in contact with the plate can be\\ndriven by the thermosyphon eﬀect or by a pump if the storage tank cannot\\nbe mounted directly above the collector, as it is in the example in Fig. 5.\\nThe other main technology uses a double walled glass evacuated tube\\nin which the gap between the walls is evacuated to block heat loss by\\nconduction and convection.53 A spectrally selective coating is applied to the\\ninner wall or to a long, narrow absorber plate which allows a circulating\\nworking ﬂuid to be heated to higher temperatures than with ﬂat plates.\\nResearch into improved collectors includes the potential use of nanoﬂuids,\\nﬂuids with suspensions of nanoparticl es, for direct absorption of sunlight\\nby the working ﬂuid.\\nA third technology in widespread use is arguably deﬁned as a solar\\nwater heating technology. Domestic scale heat pump water heaters entered\\nthe mass market with ground mounted water storage tanks and roof-\\nmounted and sun-exposed panels to evaporate the working refrigerant. How-\\never, customer resistance to the high installation cost, including the need for\\nlicensed refrigeration tradesmen to install and certify the necessary refriger-\\nant pipework, led to the packaging of the evaporator panel wrapped around\\nthe tank, trading reduced performance for greater market acceptance. See\\nChapter 8 for further information on solar water heating.\\n4.7 Passive Heating of Buildings and Solar Architecture\\nAs has already been outlined in Sec. 3 of this Introduction, the deliberate\\nand designed-in use of solar radiation has an extremely long history. The\\nidea had a strong resurgence of interest and application following the two\\noil price shocks in the 1970s and passive solar architecture was codiﬁed and'),\n",

Passive solar building design became less popular during\\nthe 1990s with lower fossil fuel costs but the old ideas together with new\\ndevelopments are experiencing resurgence. Various rating schemes55 exist\\naround the world and there are numerous regional schemes for mandating\\nor, at least encouraging, more eﬃcient building design and operation. This\\nis discussed further in Chapter 8.\\n4.8 Evaporative Cooling\\nLike domestic solar water heating, evaporative cooling is a solar technology\\nthat has achieved mass market acceptance and is sometimes overlooked as\\na contribution of solar energy to human comfort and convenience. Evapora-\\ntive cooling is a ubiquitous air conditioning choice in many of the less humid\\nclimate zones of the world. It works by using solar-heated ambient warmth\\nto extract heat from a fan-forced ﬂow of air by the latent heat of evapora-\\ntion of water. Even more simply, passive forms rely on prevailing wind to\\nblow air across ponds. It is the technology that supports the cooling towers\\nprevalent in commercial/industrial air conditioning and industrial cooling\\nand in fossil fueled and nuclear generation of electricity so it may be seen\\nthat evaporative cooling makes a huge contribution to human energy ser-\\nvices but is generally excluded from renewable energy statistics.\\nThe state of the art of evaporative cooling is described in Chapter 8 of\\nthis volume.\\n4.9 Biomass and Biofuels\\nModern application of biomass and biofuels encompasses a wide range of\\ntechnologies from eﬃcient cook stoves, mass-scale pelletization of wood and\\nwaste materials, the capture and combustion for electricity generation of\\nmethane from decaying municipal waste (landﬁll gas), to the highly techni-\\ncal production of liquid fuels from agricultural and forestry crops or wastes,\\norganic municipal waste, and cultivated algae for the subsequent extraction\\nof oil.\\nThe use of liquid biomass fuels has entered the mass market in some\\nregions of the world, most notably in Brazil with sugar-derived ethanol'),\n",

Competition for arable\\nland and water resources between energy production and food production is\\nhighly controversial. Also controversial is the ongoing debate about whether\\nthe optimal energy carrier for transportation is a liquid or gaseous biofuel or\\nsolar generated electricity.56 Of particular interest here is the prospects for\\nfuture air travel that is independent or at least less dependent on fossil fuels.\\nThe options in a carbon-constrained world, given the vast fertile land areas\\nthat would be required to produce suﬃcient biofuels, seem to be limited.\\nIn a very diﬀerent arena, biofuels from wastes or from low-value crops such\\nas copra57 may help underpin energy self suﬃciency in some remote but\\nfertile parts of the world, such as some Paciﬁc Island Nations but, here too,\\ncompetition with food production will be relevant.\\n4.10 Artiﬁcial Photosynthesis\\nThe solar-driven photocatalytic production of hydrogen or hydrocarbon\\nfuels by reduction of H2Oa n dC O2 into hydrocarbon fuels, is an extremely\\nattractive path for energy collection. These artiﬁcial processes simulate\\nnatural photosynthesis in green plants and are therefore termed artiﬁcial\\nphotosynthesis. This pairs CO2 ﬁxation with water oxidation in a carbon-\\nneutral cycle, thereby diverting or removing problematic CO 2 from the\\natmosphere and generating a storable and transportable fuel. 58 However,\\nno commercially viable system based on earth-abundant elements has yet\\nemerged, despite an intense research eﬀort over decades and experimen-\\ntation with a very large range of materials and structures.58,59 Conversion\\neﬃciencies are still low. Advances in all the areas of catalysis, semiconductor\\nphysics and engineering, surface chemistry, photocatalysis, and nanotech-\\nnology are needed. Nevertheless, there remain promising avenues and the\\ndesirability of “green” fuel production, absolutely necessary for some of\\nthe services, including air transport, on which modern life depends and\\nthe additional beneﬁt of CO2 sequestration mean that research in this ﬁeld\\nwill continue to be critically important. Chapter 6 in this volume explores\\nthis ﬁeld in depth, outlining the challenges and the most likely paths\\nforward.\\n5 Economics of Solar Energy Use\\nWe write at a time when some solar e nergy technologies, most spectac-\\nularly photovoltaics, are fulﬁlling their long-term promise to reduce costs\\nand prices to the point of credible direct competition with fossil and nuclear'),\n",

LCOE values of electricity generated from\\nsolar radiation also vary with intensity of sunlight, so they vary region-\\nally. The best regarded photovoltaics industry roadmap 61 projects a 41%\\ndecrease in LCOE between 2013 and 2024, from a base, for large systems, of\\n0.056USD/kWh (sunny regions) and 0.111USD/kWh for places with half\\nas much solar radiation. An Australian study64 estimated (updated esti-\\nmates in 2013 for 2012) a large range of LCOE for ﬁxed-tilt photovoltaics\\nfrom about 0.16 to 0.27 USD/kWh and 0.03 to 0.13 USD/kWh under dif-\\nferent sets of assumptions. A report from a consultancy, Lazard, estimated\\nfor the US ranges of 0.18–0.265USD/kWh for rooftop residential installa-\\ntions, 0.126–0.177USD/KWh for commercial and industrial systems and\\n0.072–0.086USD/KWh for utility scale.32\\nCosts for concentrated solar thermal generated electricity are less well\\ndeﬁned since the market is still small and many projects are “proof of\\nconcept” or experimental. This technology shares with concentrated solar\\nphotovoltaics many barriers to reaching commercial markets, clearly out-\\nlined more than a decade ago including restriction to clear-sky regions\\nthat, commonly are remote from human habitation (although the energy\\ntransmission costs are at least partly balanced by low land cost), the lack\\nof markets for small-scale initial installations to build cash ﬂow, incon-\\nsistent government policies, negative perceptions, competition from ﬂat-\\nplate photovoltaics and direct competition from fossil fuel power plants.47\\nNevertheless, estimates for LCOE from solar thermal electricity are still\\nreasonably attractive and projected to fall. The Australian study men-\\ntioned above found that LCOE for solarthermal electricity without storage\\nwas in the range 0.21–0.35USD/kWh and slightly higher for systems with\\nstorage in 2012 (updated in 2013)63 and projected a very wide range on\\n0.05–0.26USD/kWh in 2050. However, the same study found that coupling\\nsolar thermal to existing fossil-fueled power plants as fuel savers oﬀers much\\nmore competitive prices.65 Another estimate, for the US, estimated LCOE\\nfor concentrated thermal electricity with storage at 0.118–0.13USD/kWh\\ncurrently.\\nLow temperature water heating has contributed massively to CO2 sav-\\nings, particularly in China and Europe. 66 The economics are complex,\\ndepending on solar radiation, water usage patterns, local energy prices,\\ngovernment support, type of solar water heater, etc. A comprehensive study'),\n",

This\\nstudy used LCOE data for actual projects collected quarterly from across\\nthe globe. It noted that the cost of ﬁnance varies by technology and loca-\\ntion and this has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on LCOE, as do resource availabil-\\nity and siting. These wide, extremely wide for some technologies, ranges\\n(Fig. 7) make it challenging to draw conclusions for the whole world since\\nthere is a great deal of overlap in the ranges of LCOE for competing tech-\\nnologies. However, Fig. 7 also includes weighted averages, denoted “cen-\\ntral”.

Integrated circuits are the building blocks of \\nmost electronic devices and equipment. An integrated circuit is also known as a chip or \\nmicrochip. \\nThere are two main advantages of ICs over discrete circuits: cost and performance. Cost is \\nlow because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather  \\nthan being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermor e, much less material is used to construct a \\npackaged IC die than a discrete circuit. Performance is high since the components switch quickly and \\nconsume little power (compared to their discrete counterparts) because the components are small and \\npositioned close together. As of 2006, chip areas range from a few square millimeters to around 350 \\nmm2, with up to 1 million transistors per mm '),\n",

Polysilicon is used both as gate electrode material for MOS transistors and also as \\nan interconnect medium in silicon integrated circuits. Undoped p olysilicon has relatively high \\nresistivity. The resistivity of polysilicon can be reduced, however, by doping it with impurity atoms. \\n(f) After deposition, the polysilicon layer is patterned and etched to form the interconnects and the \\nMOS transistor gates. This is shown in Figure 1.9 (f). \\n(g) The thin gate oxide not covered by polysilicon is also etched along, which exposes the bare \\nsilicon surface on which the source and drain junctions are to be formed (Figure 1.9 (g)). \\n(h) The entire silicon surface is then doped with high concentration of impurities, either through \\ndiffusion or ion implantation (in this case with donor atoms to produce n -type doping). Diffusion is \\nachieved by heating the wafer to a high temperature and passing the gas containing desired impurities \\nover the surface. Figure 1.9 (h) shows that the doping penetrates the exposed areas on the silicon \\nsurface, ultimately creating two n -type regions (source and drain junctions) in the p -type substrate. \\nThe impurity doping also penetrates the polysilicon on the surface, reducing its resistivity. \\n(i) Once the source and drain regions are completed, the entire surface is again covered with an \\ninsulating layer of silicon dioxide, as shown in \\nFigure 1.9 (i).(j) The insulating oxide layer is then patterned in order to provide contact windows for \\nthe drain and source junctions, as illustrated in Figure 1.9 (j).

Therefore, a set of layout rules, al so called design \\nrules, has been defined.

The objective associated with \\nlayout rules is to obtain a circuit with optimum yi eld (functional circuits versus non -functional \\ncircuits) in as small as area possible without compromising reliability of the circuit. In addition, \\nDesign rules can be conservative or aggressive, depending on whether yield or performance is \\ndesired. Generally, they are a compromise between the two. Manufacturing processes have their \\ninherent limitations in accuracy. So the need of design rules arises due to manufacturing \\nproblems like – \\n• Photo resist shrinkage, tearing. \\n• Variations in material deposition, temperature and oxide thickness. \\n• Impurities. \\n• Variations across a wafer. \\nThese lead to various problems like : \\n• Transistor problems: \\nVariations in threshold voltage: This may occur due to variations in oxide thickness, ion - \\nimplantation and poly layer.

When deposition of the metal layer takes place the \\nmetal is deposited through the contact cut areas onto the underlying area so that contact is made \\nbetween the layers. \\nThe process is more complex for connecting diffusion to poly-silicon using the butting \\ncontact approach (Fig.b), In effect, a 2λ. x 2λ contact cut is made down to each of the layers to  \\nbe joined. The layers are butted together in such a way that these two contact cuts become \\ncontiguous. Since the poly-silicon and diffusion outlines overlap and thin oxide under poly \\nsilicon acts as a mask in the diffusion process, the poly-silicon and diffusion layers are also \\nbutted together. The contact between the two butting layers is then made by a metal overlay as \\nshown in the Fig. '),\n",

Each \\ndesign style has its own merits and shortcomings, and thus a proper choice has to be made by designers in order to \\nprovide the specified functionality at low cost and in a timely manner. \\n \\n Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)  Fully fabricated FPGA chips containing thousands or even more, of \\nlogic gates with programmable interconnects, are available to users for their custom hardware programming to \\nrealize desired functionality.

A typical field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip consists of I/O \\nbuffers, an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs), and programmable interconnect structures. The programming \\nof the interconnects is accomplished by programming of RAM cells whose output terminals are connected to the \\ngates of MOS pass transistors. Thus, the signal routing between the CLBs and the I/O blo cks is accomplished by \\nsetting the configurable switch matrices accordingly. The general architecture of an FPGA chip fr om Xilinx .  \\nshowing the locations of switch matrices used for interconnect routing.  \\n \\n \\n \\nGate Array Design :In terms of fast prototyping capability, the gate array (GA) ranks second after the FPGA with a \\ntypical turn -around time of a few days. While user programming is central to the design implementation of the \\nFPGA chip, metal mask design and processing is used for GA. Gate ar ray implementation requires a two -step \\nmanufacturing process: The first phase, which is based on generic (standard) masks, results in an array of \\nuncommitted transistors on each GA chip. These uncommitted chips can be stored for later customization, which is \\ncompleted by defining the metal interconnects between the trans istors of the array. Since the patterning of metallic \\ninterconnects is done at the end of the chip fabrication process, the turn-around time can still be short, a few days to \\na few weeks. A corner of a gate array chip which contains bonding pads on its left and bottom edges, diodes for 1O \\nprotection, nMOS transistors and pMOS transistors for chip output driver circuits adjacent to bonding pads, arrays \\nof nMOS transistors and pMOS transistors,  underpass wire segments, and power and ground buses along with \\ncontact windows. The availability of these routing channels simplifies the interconnections, even using one metal \\nlayer only. Interconnection patterns that perform basic logic gates can be stored in a library, which can then be used \\nto customize rows of uncommitted transistors according to the netlist. \\n \\n'),\n",

The standard cell is also called the polycell. In this \\ndesign style, all of the commonly used logic cells are developed, characterized, and stored in a standard cell library. \\nA typical library may contain a few hundred cells including inverters, NAND gates, NOR gates, complex AOI, OAI \\ngates, D latches, and flip-flops. Each gate type can be implemented in several versions to provide adequate driving \\ncapability for different fan -outs. For instance, the inverter gate can have sta ndard size, double size, and quadruple \\nsize so that the chip designer can choose the proper size to achieve high circuit speed and layout density. Each cell is \\ncharacterized according to several different characte rization categories, including: Delay time versus lo ad \\ncapacitance, Circuit simulation model, Timing simulation model, Fault simulation model, Cell data for place -and-\\nroute, Mask data. To enable automated placement of the cells and routing of inter -cell connections, each cell layout \\nis designed with a fixed height, so that a number of cells can be abutted side -by-side to form rows. The power and \\nground rails typically run parallel to the upper and lower boundaries of the cell, thus, neighboring cells share a \\ncommon power and ground bus. The input and output pins are located on the upper and lower boundaries of the cell.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFull Custom Design \\nAlthough the standard -cells based design style is sometimes called full custom design, in a strict sense, it is \\nsomewhat less than fully customized since the cells are pre -designed for general use and the same cells are utilized \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Win10\\\\Desktop\\\\data\\\\VLSI DESIGN.pdf', 'page': 111}, page_content='in many different chip designs. In a truly full-custom design, the entire mask design is done anew without use of any \\nlibrary. However, the development cost of such a design style is becoming prohibitively high. Thus, the concept of \\ndesign reuse is becoming popular in order to reduce design cycle time and development cost. The most rigorous full \\ncustom design can be the design of a memory cell, be it static or dynamic. Since the same layout design is \\nreplicated, there would not be any alternative to high density memory chip design. F or logic chip design, a good \\ncompromise can be achieved by using a combination of different design styles on the same chip, such as standard \\ncells, data -path cells and programmable logic arrays (PLAs). In real full -custom layout in which the geometry, \\norientation and placement of every transistor is done individually by the designer, design productivity is usually very \\nlow - typically a few tens of transistors per day, per designer. In digital CMOS VLSI, full -custom design is rarely \\nused due to the high lab or cost. Exceptions to this include the design of high -volume products such as memory \\nchips, high-performance microprocessors and FPGA masters. Figure 14.23 shows the full layout of the Intel 486 \\nmicroprocessor chip, which is a good example of a hybrid ful lcustom design. Here, one can identify four different \\ndesign styles on one chip: memory banks (RAM cache), data-path units consisting of bit-slice cells, control circuitry \\nmainly consisting of standard cells and PLA blocks. \\n \\n \\n '),\n",
